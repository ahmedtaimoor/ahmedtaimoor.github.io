#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Syed Ahmed Taimoor, pursuing an MS in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. My supervisor is Dr. Jiajia Li. I obtained my BS in Computer Science from I aim to bridge the gap between Machine Learning and High Performance Computing, aiming to develop scalable and more efficient (both in time and space complexity) algorithms for deep learning. Our current project aims to develop an efficient and competitive hypergraph neural network for data reprensented using tensors.
